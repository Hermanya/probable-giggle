# For tenants
## future tenants
- discoverability (make sure address is googleable)
- landing page
    - pictures (looking nice and modern)
    - unit plans (with [interactive links](http://kitchenplanner.ikea.com/CA/UI/Pages/VPUI.htm?Lang=en-CA))
    - pricing
    - book appointment button (no phone pls)

## new tenants
- nice onboarding videos
- tour guide around neighbourhood

## present tenants
- contact info
- web notifications (fire drill and stuff)
- online payments (this is the hardest part)

# For supers
- recommend them some news cross posting tool
- button to post an ad on kijiji

# For owners
- have google analytics set up for some kind of stats

other things:
have cozy airbnb style ui
actually we should rip off as much ux from there as would make sense
